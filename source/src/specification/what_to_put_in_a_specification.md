# What to put in a Specification

How you write and organise your specification is up to you.

Verifying your specification will be easier if your specification consists of assertions that are:

* clear
* mutually exclusive
* collectively exhaustive

Thus, it often makes sense to use lists in a specification.

See [the Guessing Game Demo](https://github.com/blprnt-org/guess-demo/tree/main/GuessingGame/Guessing%20Game%20Specification) for a simple working specification.
