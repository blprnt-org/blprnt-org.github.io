# Markdown Formatting

Markdown is a way of defining formatted text using plain text. Because it is plain text it is excellent for producing text that can be manipulated by a computer program such as *blprnt*.

View the [markdown reference](https://commonmark.org/help/) for formatting syntax. Some simple formatting syntax is described below.

## Headings

To create a heading prefix a line with one or more `#`. The more `#`, the smaller the heading.

```markdown
# Big Heading
## Smaller Heading
### Smaller Heading
```

> # Big Heading
> ## Smaller Heading
> ### Smaller Heading

## Lists

```markdown
* first
* second
* third
```

> * first
> * second
> * third
