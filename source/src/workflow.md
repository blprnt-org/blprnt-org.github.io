# Workflow

With *blprnt* you can write your tests, your code and your specification in any order you like, iteratively or not.

Start blprnt

Write specification. 

For each assertion in the specification
    Write a test

Repeat

Nice graphic of circular process


Section about adding a specification to an existing application: 

* create a specification directory
* add a specification markdown file
* Add a declarative statement about something your system does
* write a test that verifies that statement
* add assertion metadata
